Immediate:
    -Write a usage section into README.md
    -Update all functions to respect archived notes    
    -On note addition, if a tag is added that includes markup used in the
     help message, print a warning saying that those characters aren't needed
     for the parameter, and will be saved as a part of the tag, and so must
     be included when trying to use the tag in a filter or search operation

Roadmap:
    -Some kind of time based filtering
    -Improved commandline input (working arrow keys ffs)
    -Database encryption? Maybe

Ongoing:
    -Keep tweaking search algorithm weights
