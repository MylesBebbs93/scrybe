Implement import functionality:
    *Edit edit note function to include mode switching between
        specifying a body and specifying a path
        (Should notes remember the path they came from an auto update?)
    *Build import function, mapped to "i/I", that takes a title, a path
        to a file, and a set of tags, very similar to add function

Ongoing:
    *Keep tweaking search algorithm weights
