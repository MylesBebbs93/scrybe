Immediate:
    -Add exclusionary tags to filter system
        -Exclude (-) as a valid tag starting character
        -Add check for (-) in front of any tag

Roadmap:
    -Ability to export all tags in a filter
    -Potentially build a gui web app? Maybe. I've walked this road before

Ongoing:
    -Keep tweaking search algorithm weights
