Immediate:
    -Review database encryption code:
        -Clean up implementation
        -Make it safer as regards sudden script failure
        -Improve library detection maybe
        -Add random iv's and read them from config file
        -Reconsider password hashing function
        -Generally stop writing encryption code at three in the morning
            -I guess this point should probably be in ongoing, not immediate
            -Or maybe roadmap. Hmmmm :/
    -Add a changelog to the readme, that documents the latest changes

Roadmap:
    -Potentially build a gui web app? Maybe. I've walked this road before
    -Improved commandline input (working arrow keys ffs)

Ongoing:
    -Keep tweaking search algorithm weights
