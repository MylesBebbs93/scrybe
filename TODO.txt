    -Add a changelog to the readme, that documents the latest changes
    -Make setup.py try to import old notes if it finds a scrybe.db file
        -Make upgrade to new release process more seamless

Roadmap:
    -Some kind of time based filtering
    -Improved commandline input (working arrow keys ffs)
