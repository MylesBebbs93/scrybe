Immediate:
    -Add a changelog to the readme, that documents the latest changes
    -Improve export command:
        - Auto replace ~ with /home/whatever
        - If the user given filename ends in a /, append the note title
    -Write documentation of how the export command works in README.md
    -Make setup.py try to import old notes if it finds a scrybe.db file
        -Make upgrade to new release process more seamless

Roadmap:
    -Some kind of time based filtering
    -Improved commandline input (working arrow keys ffs)
    -Database encryption? Maybe

Ongoing:
    -Keep tweaking search algorithm weights
