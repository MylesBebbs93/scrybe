#Scrybe
Scrybe is a simple terminal application for taking notes, using your favourite terminal editor, and storing them in an sqlite database. Notes consist of a title, a body and a set of comma separated tags that can be used to sort them however you like. Scrybe includes a search function at the minute, and a filtering function to allow you to view all the notes of a certain tag will be added when I get around to it. Don't like something, or want something? Add an issue, submit a pull request or fork the repo :). There is a todo file, but I won't promise to keep it exceptionally up to date.

## Setup:

* Clone the repo:
`git clone https://github.com/oliverb123/scrybe scrybe/`

* Change directory in to ./scrybe:
`cd scrybe`

* Run setup.py:
`python setup.py`

* Choose the best editor:
`Vim, emacs or nano?: Vim`

That's it. `scrybe` is now an alias in your .bashrc, and you're good to go

### Enjoy!!
