## Setup:

* Clone the repo:
`git clone https://github.com/oliverb123/scrybe scrybe/`

* Change directory in to ./scrybe:
`cd scrybe`

* Run setup.py:
`python setup.py`

* Choose the best editor:
`Vim, emacs or nano?: Vim`

That's it. `scrybe` is now an alias in your .bashrc, and you're good to go

### Enjoy!!
